# Laravel + React + MySQL dockerized project.

## How to build?

### Prepare Environment

!!!This project utilises a multi-domain web app. So you'll need to have at least two subdomains available: api.training.com and training.com on the local machine or in the cloud.


*Locate and edit the "hosts" file of your OS and adjust loopback of the hosts IP. (you have to do your own research to make it work)


### Rename:
Rename the .env.example file in the root directory AND in the api folder to .env.

### Build
Use the docker compose up command to run the Docker Compose project.

### Check
Visit [training.com](HTTP://training.com) training works for to check if it works.
